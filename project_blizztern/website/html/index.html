			<div id="FAQ" class="question">Q1: What is this website about?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>This website has three main goals:</p>
				<p>1.Speaking my mind: I want to say everything on my mind to the person reading this.</p>
				<p>2.Internship promotion: I wanted to extend the blizzard's internship program form a bit, thus giving me another chance to make a good (or maybe bad) impression on the people reviewing my application.</p>
				<p>3.Improvement: I want to improve! If you have any feedback whatsoever, please send me a direct message via <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Vasilbgf" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question">Q2: Who are you?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Depending who you ask you may get a wildly different answer. To some I'm a genius, to others - a complete idiot. Truth is, I'm somewhere in the middle and I'm constantly shifting between either.</p>
				<p>My name is Vasil Kolev, I'm 20 years old and I'm currently in university. Formerly I was a student at the Technical school "Electrical Systems" or "ELSYS" where I got most of my skills from. Now I'm looking towards my distant future and planning my steps to success. I've always dreamt of working at Blizzard and it's "about damn time" I started to work towards that.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q3: What is your skill set?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>I have some useful skills under my belt.</p>
				<p>As a programmer I have worked with C, C++, Java, MathLab, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby and a little bit of Assembly. Most of these I've used during High School. After that I've worked as a freelancer for a year using mainly C++ and more specifically QT during the last months. I have seen the Microsoft flavor, UNIX variant and QT's implementation of C++ standards and programming styles during this time. I have a very good understanding of low-level fundamental ideas and structures of computer science that help me learn new languages faster. A limited amount of code made during my studies is available on my GitHub page <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Vbgf/Nonsence" target="_blank">here</a> where the source for this very site can be found.</p>
				<p>As a general IT guy I can troubleshoot and fix PCs (both hardware and software problems) and have been doing so from 6th grade. I'm currently the tech guy for the entire family and their friends. I had to use TeamViewer to fix a broken Firefox installation during the writing of this very segment.</p>
				<p>As a creator I don't have much examples to show you but I'm currently playing around with Photoshop. The banner picture of the site (the castle) was made entirely by me. This was my second piece, digital or otherwise, after the "keyboard warrior" shown on the bottom of the page. I've done some simple 3d object using 3DS MAX for school too.</p>
				<p>As a hobbyist I can make some really simple electrical circuits and can program a microcontroller to do something.</p>
				<p>And finally as some miscellaneous  stuff: I can present well, I'm a master of Excel formula creation and have a Bulgarian driver's license.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q4: Where did you learn these stuff?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Most of my skills came from High School. I have to give it credit, it was an awesome experience altogether. I've learned SolidWorks in university. General PC troubleshooting and fixing came natural during the many years I've been using it. Hardware repairs came after that when I took apart my parent's computer for the first time while they were not looking. 3DS MAX and Photoshop came later from the desire to materialize some of the great ideas that I had in my head. I have some electrical skills from tinkering with old broken toys and more recently - from an Arduino starter kit and university lessons.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q5: Have you worked before?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Yes. I have been working since the end of 12th grade as a freelance programmer as mentioned above. I had various tasks there, including writing a driver for a tanker fuel meter, windows cross app communication experiment, a couple of converters and most recently a COM port monitoring tool with QT.</p>
				<p>Also for three months during the summer of 2017 I was abroad to the UK (London) where I worked for the German company GFK as an intern. I helped with more general project manager stuff like comparing data from different independent sources, Excel sheet manipulation and automation.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q6: What are the employer's thoughts on you so far?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>I did the best I can at both positions and I think they are happy. You have to ask them that personally for the maximum objective truth though.</p>
				<p>Mr. Kiril Kirilov - freelance mentor: kiril.kirilov@gmail.com</p>
				<p>Ms. Nicola Blenman - GFK mentor: Nicola.Blenman@gfk.com</p>

			<div class="question">Q7: Why work at Blizzard?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>I love everything that you guys do! Since I was little I loved watching my brother play Starcraft: Brood War and though he totally nuked me every single time I played against him I still loved every minute of it. Then Warcraft 3 and WoW WotLK were the go-to games of my teen years. Then recently I've been playing HS, HotS and Legion. I love Overwatch though I'm still playing only on the free weekends. (I was going to get it this Black Friday but I got carried away working on this website and forgot...).</p>
				<p>Every single game is a classic, every single one is a guide for "How to make great games" and I want to be a part of that. Working at Blizzard is a dream of mine since I first asked myself the question "what do you want to do for a living?" at 7th grade. Since then the answer is still the same - "I want to help Blizzard make great stuff". Applying now during the internship program both sides can see what the other is worth firsthand while the stakes are relatively low. Moving abroad with my future family at the age of 35 will be much more difficult than having a single person fly over for the summer.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q8: What would you do if Blizzard doesn't hire you?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>I will definitely take the feedback, improve and try again next year, and the year after that, and the one after. Try, fail and improve, repeat unitll success - that's my motto. During next summer I will fly over to the US with a student exchange program and if everything goes according to plan I will be somewhere near Blizzard HQ. Then I will come over and hopefully meet some people firsthand. I will be definitely out on the street giving away flyers promoting myself. You guys can look forward to that :)</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Q9: How long have you been working on this website?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>It took about two weeks of fulltime work. This translates to about a month of my life.<!-- If you are interested, there is a "The making of" section of the website that you can find <a class="link" href="creation.html" target="_blank">here</a>.--></p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question">Q10: Is there more?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Well, not really. I've said what was on my mind with close to zero filters. I would only ask for feedback one more time, evolution and improvements are essential. The best way to do this is via a direct message on <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Vasilbgf" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
				<p>There are a couple of <a class="link" href="#external" target="_blank">external links</a> on this website. If someone's going to do any background checks in any point I figured I'd make their lives a little bit easier. There are links to my <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/VasetoBGFreak" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Vasilbgf" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, though I'm not much of a social media guy as you'll quickly realize. Also there is a link to my <a class="link" href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/aggramar/purerandom" target="_blank">armory</a> if you fancy a good transmog idea for a frost Death Knight. Take care!</p>
